Fail2Ban is a powerful tool that scans log files (e.g., /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/apache2/access.log) for suspicious patterns (failed login attempts, probing, etc.) and bans offending IP addresses by updating firewall rules.

Hereâ€™s a complete procedure, algorithm, and necessary commands to set it up:


---

âœ… Procedure to Use Fail2Ban

1. Install Fail2Ban

On Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install fail2ban -y

On CentOS/RHEL:

sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install fail2ban -y


---

2. Create a Local Configuration File

Copy the default jail configuration file:

sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local


---

3. Edit the Configuration (jail.local)

Open the file:

sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

Basic Global Settings:

[DEFAULT]
bantime = 600                # Ban duration in seconds
findtime = 300               # Time window to count failures
maxretry = 5                 # Number of allowed failures
backend = auto
usedns = warn


---

4. Enable a Specific Jail (e.g., SSH)

Inside jail.local, enable a jail:

[sshd]
enabled = true
port    = ssh
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3

Other examples:

Apache: /var/log/apache2/access.log

Nginx: /var/log/nginx/error.log



---

5. Create/Customize a Filter (Optional)

Filters are located in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/.

Each filter is a regex pattern that matches malicious log entries.

Example for SSH (sshd.conf):

[Definition]
failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)sFailed password for .* from <HOST> port \d+ ssh2
ignoreregex =


---

6. Start and Enable Fail2Ban

sudo systemctl start fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban


---

7. Check Status

sudo fail2ban-client status
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd


---

ðŸ§  Fail2Ban Algorithm Overview

1. Monitor logs defined in logpath.


2. Use regex filters to match suspicious activity (e.g., failed logins).


3. Count failures over a period (findtime).


4. If maxretry is exceeded:

Trigger action: ban IP using iptables, firewalld, or other methods.



5. Unban IPs after bantime unless manually configured otherwise.

ðŸ”§ Useful Commands

Manually ban an IP:

sudo fail2ban-client set sshd banip <IP_ADDRESS>

Unban IP:

sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP_ADDRESS>

Reload Fail2Ban:

sudo systemctl reload fail2ban

Check logs:

sudo cat /var/log/fail2ban.log

Let me know if you'd like help writing a custom filter for a specific log format or service (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Postfix, etc.).
