To identify the IP address of a machine running an SSH server, you can follow these steps depending on whether you are scanning your own network or already have access to the target machine.

🔍 1. From the Attacker Machine (e.g., Kali Linux)

✅ Method: Use Nmap to Scan for SSH (Port 22)

Run this command to scan your local network for machines with SSH open:

nmap -p 22 --open -sV 192.168.1.0/24

Replace 192.168.1.0/24 with your network range.

-p 22 scans for SSH.

--open filters only hosts with the port open.

-sV detects the service version.


🔎 Sample Output:

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.10
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3

> This tells you that the machine at 192.168.1.10 has SSH running.

💻 2. From the Target Machine (if you have access)

✅ Method: Use ip or ifconfig

For newer systems:

ip a

Look for inet under interfaces like eth0 or wlan0.

For older systems:

ifconfig

You'll see something like:

eth0: inet 192.168.1.10  netmask 255.255.255.0

This is the IP address of the machine running SSH.

🌐 3. Use ARP and Ping Sweep (if unsure of the range)

Step 1: Identify your own IP and network

ip a

Suppose your IP is 192.168.1.5, then the range is likely 192.168.1.0/24.

Step 2: Run Nmap Ping Sweep

nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

Then scan specific IPs for SSH as shown earlier.

🛡️ Pro Tip:

If you’re running a lab with VMs (e.g., Kali + Metasploitable), you can use:

netdiscover

This shows all devices on your network with their IPs and MACs. Then scan each with nmap for port 22.
